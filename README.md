# CSCI-3130-Grader
Small program that saves huge amount of time on grading logisim labs.

You may find student list (students_list2.txt) or create your own and import it. Please note that there is no gui interface for student list import, but you can just call load_student_list_into_grades_db() function and provide correct name of the expected file.
